                <article> 
                    <p>A <strong>cat</strong> has the power to sometimes heal themselves by purring.A domestic cat’s purr has a frequency
                        of between 25 and 150 Hertz, which happens to be the frequency at which muscles and bones best grow
                        and repair themselves.</p>
                    <p> A cat’s cerebral cortex contains about twice as many neurons as that of dogs. Cats have 300 million
                        neurons, whereas dogs have about 160 million.<em>See, cats rule, dogs drool!</em></p>

                <aside>Unlike humans, cats are usually lefties. Studies indicate that their left paw is typically their dominant paw.</aside>
