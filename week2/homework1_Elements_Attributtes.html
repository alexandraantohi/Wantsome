        <p>Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity,
            positive reviews and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often 
            considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies 
            worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages.[3] The last four books
            consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final installment selling roughly eleven million copies in
            the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.</p>
